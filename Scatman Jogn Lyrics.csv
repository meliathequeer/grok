Scatman's World,16,Everybody's talkin' something very shocking
Scatman's World,17,Just to keep on blockin' what they're feelin' inside

Scatman's World,29,Everybody's born to compete as he chooses
Scatman's World,30,But how can someone win if winning means that someone loses?
Scatman's World,31,I sit and see and wonder what it's like to be in touch
Scatman's World,32,No wonder all my brothers and my sisters need a crutch
Scatman's World,33,"I wanna be a human being, not a human doing"
Scatman's World,34,I couldn't keep that pace up if I tried
Scatman's World,35,The source of my intention really isn't crime prevention

Quiet Desperation,1,You're sitting on a milk crate mornin' noon and night
Quiet Desperation,2,Fantisizin' the American dream
Quiet Desperation,3,You're lookin' pretty good and you've got yourself convinced
Quiet Desperation,4,That the nightmare isn't as bad as it seems
Quiet Desperation,5,You try your best to hide yourself beneath your turned up collar
Quiet Desperation,6,And a plastic bag is all you've got to show
Quiet Desperation,7,And your books inside your shopping cart
Quiet Desperation,8,Is probably the best education you're ever gonna know (Hmm)
Quiet Desperation,9,The guy in the Mercedes is just hollered with the dollar
Quiet Desperation,10,Better grab it 'cause the signal's turnin' green
Quiet Desperation,11,"And while you're at it, put the jug behind the picket fence"
Quiet Desperation,12,Cause the cop that's drivin' by sho' looking mean
Quiet Desperation,13,"Institution, contribution, restitution, destitution"
Quiet Desperation,14,Doesn't mean a thing to you now
Quiet Desperation,15,"You're the freeway feature, for your audience are driving by"
Quiet Desperation,16,So maybe you should stand and take a bow
Quiet Desperation,17,You're living in desperation
Quiet Desperation,18,And you never have felt complete
Quiet Desperation,19,You live in anticipation
Quiet Desperation,20,"Of another day on the street, sing with me"
Quiet Desperation,21,"You're sitting in the same spot, you want to go home"
Quiet Desperation,22,But there ain't no home but home on the range
Quiet Desperation,23,You've forgotten what you look like and it looks like you've forgotten
Quiet Desperation,24,That the look inside your eye is very strange
Quiet Desperation,25,"Ain't nothing left to hide, you're stripped of all your pride"
Quiet Desperation,26,And all you feel inside is a hole a mile wide
Quiet Desperation,27,You're the freedom desperado and the perfect living model
Quiet Desperation,28,Of a land that hasn't any good excuse
Quiet Desperation,29,"Sittin' on your milkcrate, blanket wrapped around you"
Quiet Desperation,30,I see you sitting day after day
Quiet Desperation,31,"I really like to talk, but I know if I approached you"
Quiet Desperation,32,You'd probably get up and walk away
Quiet Desperation,33,You're wishin' that your home of the American dream
Quiet Desperation,34,Wasn't only smoke and exhaust
Quiet Desperation,35,"I love you, desperado, and all I gotta say"
Quiet Desperation,36,You let me know how much I really lost
